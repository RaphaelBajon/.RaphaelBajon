## Hey all 👋

My profile on Github is under construction 🦦, being particularly new to the github community 🙇‍. Working between deep learning/AI, oceanography and climate change. 

<!--I really want to collaborate to open source and as Github says, I hope I will rock 🎸 ! [About the open source](https://opensource.guide/)-->
