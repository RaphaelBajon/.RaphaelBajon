## Hey all, this is me 👋

My profile on Github is under construction 🦦, being particularly new to the github community 🙇‍. Feel free to follow me to collaborate on various works, such as artificial intelligence, neural networks and climate change. 

<!--I really want to collaborate to open source and as Github says, I hope I will rock 🎸 ! [About the open source](https://opensource.guide/)-->

Lots of thing to come here 🌍 

### 👓 Appendix

From my previous and current work as a data scientist intern or a PhD candidate : **[plastic](https://github.com/raphaelbajon/plastic-progress)** and **[carbon](https://github.com/raphaelbajon/carbon-progress)** folders :+1:.
